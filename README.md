Excited to share my latest project: a dynamic and user-friendly
Weather Application!
This application fetches real-time weather data using a live API to provide instant and accurate updates for any location worldwide.

Key Features:
• Search weather by city name with live data 
• Live weather data ( 🌡️ Temperature ,☁️Weather , 💨 Wind ,💧 Humidity)
 powered by an API.
• Search functionality for any city.
• Clean, responsive design for a seamless mobile and desktop experience.

💡 What I Learned:
 • Calling external APIs with fetch() and async/await.
 • Displaying weather data for different cities.
 • Displaying key weather metrics like humidity and wind speed.
 • Implementing a forecast section.
 • Handling search functionality.

I built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make asynchronous API calls and dynamically update the page.
